                    Grass Wonder (Japanese: グラスワンダー, 18 February 1995 – 8 August 2025) 
                    was an American-bred Japanese-trained Thoroughbred 
                    racehorse and sire. In a racing career which lasted 
                    from 1997 until 2000 he won nine of his fifteen races 
                    including four Grade I races. He was the leading 
                    juvenile colt in Japan in 1997 when he was unbeaten 
                    in four races, culminating in a victory in the 
                    Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes. He missed most of his 
                    second season with injury problems but returned 
                    in autumn to win the Arima Kinen. He reached his 
                    peak as a four-year-old when he won the Takarazuka Kinen 
                    and a second Arima Kinen. He failed to win in three races 
                    in 2000 and was retired to stud. He had some 
                    success as a breeding stallion.

                    Grass Wonder was a chestnut horse with a white star, 
                    standing 15.3½ hands high bred in Kentucky by 
                    Phillips Racing Partnership & John Phillips, of 
                    the Darby Dan Farm. He was sired by Silver Hawk, 
                    an American-bred colt who finished third in the 
                    1982 Epsom Derby and later became a successful 
                    breeding stallion, siring the 1997 Epsom Derby 
                    winner Benny the Dip, the 1999 St Leger winner 
                    Mutafaweq and the leading American turf performer 
                    Hawkster. Grass Wonder's dam Ameriflora was an 
                    unraced daughter of Danzig. She was a great-granddaughter 
                    of Soaring, an American broodmare who was the ancestor 
                    of many major winners including Glorious Song, 
                    Saint Ballado, Rahy and Singspiel. The yearling 
                    was consigned to the Keeneland sale in September 
                    1996 and was bought for $250,000 by Nobuo Tsunoda. 
                    Grass Wonder was exported to Japan where he was 
                    trained by Mitsuhiro Ogata and was mainly ridden 
                    in his races by Hitoshi Matoba.
